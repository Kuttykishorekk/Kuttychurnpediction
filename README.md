# churn-prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for an E-Commerce platform using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest Classifier. By analyzing customer behavior and relevant features, the goal is to identify patterns indicating the likelihood of churn.

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd churn-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary packages for analysis and model building:

```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
openpyxl
xlrd
```

## KuttyChurn Package

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine and install the package using `pip`:

```bash
cd churn-prediction/KuttyChurn
pip install .
```

### Components

- `data_preparation.py`: Load and clean the raw E-commerce dataset.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Extract and preprocess features for model training.
- `model_training.py`: Train the machine learning model, focusing on Random Forest Classifier.
- `predict.py`: Make predictions on new data using the trained model.
- `visualization.py`: Visualize model performance and feature importances.

### Usage

1. Prepare your dataset using `data_preparation`.
2. Process your dataset further with `feature_engineering`.
3. Train your model using `model_training`.
4. Make predictions on new data with `predict`.
5. Visualize model performance using `visualization`.

## Running the Project

Execute the `main.py` script to perform data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation:

```bash
python main.py
```
